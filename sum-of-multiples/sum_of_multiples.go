// PSEUDO BRAINSTORM:
// Given a number find multiples up to that number that are divisible by given numbers then add them together
// Ex: Given 20, find UNIQUE numbers up to but not including 20 that are divisible by 3 & 5
// Solution: 3, 5, 6, 9, 10, 12, 15, and 18. Added together equals 78

// start out with a total variable set to 0. Will get added to as modulo operator finds numbers
// for all numbers in the max number - 1 divide by array of ints in divisors
// how to best go through array of divisors? Another for loop adds would make it n^2 operation
